	//Declare a Variable to hold a value of a certain type

	//initializing a variable
	fmt.Printf("printing as hex, %x ", J)
	fmt.Printf("printing as binary, %b ", J)

	//zero value is usually used when var is declared
	//use shortcut to assign variables typically - short declaration operator

	//numeral systems -hexadecimal is actually super cool
